# Annoying-Loader
Its actually called a simple loader... But its annoying if you waiting for something to load. 
In fact, they did research(source: trust me bro)
And found people did not trust super fast programs because they 
assumed something went wrong.
So programs are built to give the illusion of "thinking"
to gain favour. How about that?
